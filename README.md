# Minesweeper

The game about avoiding mines! One of the first games you would find upon opening the games tab over 20 years ago on a computer. I personally don't know anyone who's won a round of Minesweeper; nonetheless, this game is a childhood classic for me!

Definitely enjoyed recreating this classic! The base of the game requires a connected web of recurring functions that made this quite a puzzle to build. The styling of it is something I plan to revisit in the future.

I tried a few times to beat my own game, but I was still no good...

This project taught me much about how the base of your code is fundamental to everything else working. I struggled much with designing the first part of this code to get everything working in harmony.

Challenges and themes I ran into while creating my version of Minesweeper include making consistent 'win' logic to facilitate when a player actually wins. This as well as controlling a core aspect of the game, the number of mines. 

Overall, this project showcases a strong base of DOM Manipulation and function recursion that is sure to make me confused if I ever tried to build it again. Let me know what you think!
